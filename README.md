From my analysis the top performing schools are Charter Schools whose overall perfomance is aboe 90%. This is backed by the data from the charter schools whose overall performance is above 90% compared to the District schools averaging in the 50 - 60 percent range.
The District schools tend to have higher student populations, it can be said that this affects student performance. However Charter Schools with high population like Wilson High School with a population of 2,283 still averages a performance of 90.33% from the data set. 
Based on this it can be assumed that there is more to the factors affecting performance like methods of delivery.
